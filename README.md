### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js: (Node version: 18)** Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. React Native requires Node.js to run the JavaScript build process and manage dependencies.
2. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** React Native requires the JDK to build and run Android applications. Make sure you have JDK 8 or later installed.
3. **Android development environment:** Setting up the Android development environment is necessary if you want to develop and test Android apps. This includes installing Android Studio and setting up the necessary Android SDK and virtual devices.
4. **Xcode:** If you're targeting iOS devices, you'll need to have Xcode installed. Xcode provides the necessary tools for building and running iOS apps, as well as the iOS simulator for testing.
5. **React Native CLI:** Install the React Native Command Line Interface globally on your machine using npm or yarn. The CLI provides essential tools and commands for creating, building, and running React Native applications.
6. **Editor/IDE:** Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that you are comfortable with for writing React Native code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
7. **Git:** Version control is essential when working on software projects. Install Git to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage your codebase effectively.
